  <h4>How does Axie infinity work?</h4>

    <h5><i>
      In Axie Infinity, every monster is a non-fungible token (NFT). Players earn tokens by engaging in turn-based battles with other players or computer-controlled teams. These tokens are then used to “breed” new monsters by creating more NFTs.</i></h5>

      <p>what is Axie infinity?</p>
      <p>Axie Infinity is an online game universe revolving around Pokémon-esque creatures known as Axies. Players can collect Axies as virtual pets with aspirations to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. What makes Axie Infinity different from other online games is the synergy it has established between standard online gaming and blockchain. The Ethereum-based game utilizes a design that allows players to own their virtual assets and rewards players who are able to reach an advanced level of skil</p>
    
     <p>To get started, users need to work through a multistep setup process to connect digital wallets and their Axie Infinity account, which is all detailed in the game’s onboarding guide.</p>
  
    <p>Once the accounts are successfully connected, the player can interact with the digital marketplace. To play, users need three Axies. Once the player has three Axies, they can download the application and start playing. There is a lot of nuance around the cost of an Axie since the average price that is paid fluctuates based on factors such as rarity, experience, attributes, and type. As of this writing, the least expensive Axies, known as “Floor Axies,” cost around $30. Floor Axies are often weak in battle and likely won’t be able to earn much for its owner. As of this writing, players can expect to pay a few hundred U.S. dollars for a usable team of Axies and upward of $1,000 for a rare Mystic Axie.</p>

<p>
what is gods unchained?
</p>

<p> ‍Gods Unchained is one of the gaming industry’s new forays into blockchain and cryptocurrency. It is a free-to-play online trading card game that is similar to Magic: The Gathering Arena. The Gods Unchained video game describes itself as the trading card game that “pays to play.” It is shaking up the normal model of gaming commerce where players purchase the game along with in-game items that they will never be able to sell back.</p>

<p>Players will be able to earn the native GODS token that acts as a payment method throughout the game. Rare cards have unique real-world value as they can be sold for GODS, which can be transferred to fiat money. This model gives players more incentive to play as they have complete ownership over the valuable assets they accumulate over time.</p>
<p>The game was first announced in 2018 when it made its first mythic card sale. Since then, they have sold millions of cards, raised $15 million in Series A funding and launched their first season of the game. The game is exploding in popularity, along with other NFT and crypto-based games that attract those who want to earn while having fun.</p>
